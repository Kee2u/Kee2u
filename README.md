### Hi there! :koala:

#My name is Keerthana but you can call me Keetu. I work as a mechatronics engineer but love painting on the side! I use my studio to paint and code :bowtie:. 

Im currently going through UofT's data analytics bootcamp and I will be uploading super cool data analytics projects soon!

My project goals:
- Work on a smart city project with data and IoT
- :space_invader: Create a game with real mini flying spaceships that you have to take down using lazers
-  Merge machine learning and econometrics and work on a policy problem
- :art: See my paintings in a museum :see_no_evil:
- :herb: Help my friend's landscaping business by working on data driven marketing
